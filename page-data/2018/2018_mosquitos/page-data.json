Staff observed flying insects, identified as non-biting midges, near the water and to a lesser extent near the caretaker’s road. These midges are commonplace throughout the region from spring through fall and are not something that Denver Water would mitigate near a reservoir, as it would require pesticide use.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Denver Water staff took water samples in the reservoir to check for mosquito larvae. The good news is that no mosquito larvae was found. This is consistent with what we would expect, as larvae need extremely still bodies of water to survive. In a reservoir the size of Tanabe, there is sufficient movement in the water to prevent larvae from surviving.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Reservoir Mosquitos?!","date":"May 19, 2018"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2018/2018_mosquitos/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018/2018_join_board/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"A Call for Nominations"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2018/2018-10-02-MeetingMinutes/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"October Belle Creek Metro District Meeting Minutes"}}}}}

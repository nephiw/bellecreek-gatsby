School is about to start so we are about to have a lot more cars and kids on the roads. You will likely know most of these, but lets work to keep these streets safe and friendly.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../../uploads/street_corner.jpg\" alt=\"a corner in Belle Creek\"></p>\n<p>Here are a few things to be aware of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is against Commerce City laws to park in front of a house that you do not own for longer than 5 hours.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Parking is often contentious in our neighborhood. Most of these rules exist for safety reasons. Here are a few places where it is against Commerce City laws to park:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Within 5 feet of a driveway</li>\n<li>Within 15 feet of a fire hydrant</li>\n<li>Within 20 feet of a crosswalk or intersection</li>\n<li>Within 30 feet in front of a stop sign</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The speed limit is 25 miles per hour through the entire community. During school hours the fine for exceeding the speed limit doubles.</li>\n<li>Commercial vehicles are not allowed on our streets. Our streets are incredibly narrow, so big rigs are likely to get stuck.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to see the details of these laws, you can read them on <a href=\"http://c3gov.com\" title=\"Commerce City Website\">c3gov.com</a> here: <a href=\"http://www.c3gov.com/home/showdocument?id=816\" title=\"http://www.c3gov.com/home/showdocument?id=816\">http://www.c3gov.com/home/showdocument?id=816</a></p>\n<p>Above all, be safe and respectful out there.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Commerce City \"Rules of the Streets\"","date":"August 03, 2017"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/2017/2017_street_use_notice/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/2017/2017_spring_yard_sale_map/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Yard Sale 2017 Map"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/2017/august_water_district/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Tanabe Reservoir August Update"}}}}}

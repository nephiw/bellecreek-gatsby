This project will facilitate future operation of the Tanabe reservoir, which will be located on that land. They are working on the existing fence, putting in private road improvements and adding a few water control structures. Another major part of the project not seen on the following map is a large amount of electrical work that will need to happen before we can operate the reservoir.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../../uploads/2017/2017-02-15-TanabeReservoirMap.jpg\" alt=\"map of updated reservoir\"></p>\n<p>This project started August 29 and will continue until the middle of January 2018. This end date could change depending on when the contractor can get the needed material from their distribution center in Houston. It is still our hope to start filling the reservoir in spring 2018.</p>\n<p>Residents can expect an increase in construction traffic and a visible presence of construction at the site.</p>\n<p>The first part of the project will be the removal of the 6-foot tall fence running along property lines southeast of the reservoir. They will be removing the current 6-foot tall fence, create a 6-foot rock-covered firebreak and then install a new 8-foot tall fence at the edge of the firebreak (six feet from the current fence position.) The reasons for this change in fencing are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To ensure the safety of the public and to deter individuals from entering the property.</li>\n<li>To create a fire break to enhance the safety of the neighborhood from potential grass fires.</li>\n<li>To meet perimeter regulations for operational reservoirs.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The 6-foot strip of land in between the fence and the homes will be maintained by Denver Water. It has been asked that residents do not place anything in that area including personal items (i.e. chairs, plants, storage items), plants or trash. To function as an effective fire break, the area must be kept clear.</p>\n<p>If the contractor has trouble acquiring the 8-foot fence from their distribution center, they will use the 6-foot fence as a temporary place holder until the 8-foot fence arrives.</p>\n<p>The Tanabe Reservoir is part of Denver Water’s downstream reservoir system.

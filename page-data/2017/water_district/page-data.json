As you can see from the map, Denver Water is working on the existing fence, putting in road improvements and adding a few water control structures. Another major part of the project not seen on the map is a large amount of electrical work that will need to happen before they can operate the reservoir.</p>\n<p><img src=\"../../../uploads/2017/2017-02-15-TanabeReservoirMap.jpg\" alt=\"map of updated reservoir\"></p>\n<p>They will be replacing the fence running along property lines adjacent to Belle Creek homes, southeast of the reservoir. They will remove the current 6’ fence, create a 6’ rock-covered fire break and then install a new 8’ fence at the edge of the firebreak (6’ from the current fence position.) The reasons for this change in fencing are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>To ensure the safety of the public and to deter individuals from entering the property.</li>\n<li>To create a fire break to enhance the safety of the neighborhood from potential grass fires.</li>\n<li>To meet perimeter regulations for operational reservoirs.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Residents can expect an increase in construction traffic and a visible presence of construction at the site.
